Welcome to the Mode Playbook! Playbook is a repository of open-source SQL queries and visualizations you can tailor to your data. All the reports are designed to be used in [Mode](http://www.modeanalytics.com/), and live examples are available in Mode and on the [Playbook](http://about.modeanalytics.com/playbook) page.

Playbook reports are designed to answer common questions that many companies ask. Each report provides access to the raw SQL query and the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code that powers the visualization. 

To read more, see the [Playbook](http://about.modeanalytics.com/playbook) page on Mode. [Additional documentation](https://modeanalytics.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203511970-Playbook-Overview) is also available.

If you have comments, suggestions for improvements, requests for additional reports—or best of all, analysis that you too would like to open source—we'd love to hear from you. We can be reached at [hi@modeanalytics.com](mailto:hi@modeanalytics.com).
